# SELF SUSTAINING BLOCKCHAIN FRAMEWORK

## Overview and Origin

> ANKR is based in Berkely CA and was founded in 2017 by co-founders Chandler Song, Ryan Fang & Stanley Wu. Developers of blockchain protocols seeking to improve efficientcy of public ledgers while providing a decentralized computing framework by reallocating cloud computing power left from idle data centers around the world. The model being deployed by ANKR could level the playing field by provding power to applicaitons, bitcoin mining, node hosting, the IOT and more. An estimated $27.3M has be received via Venture Capital Backed and Private Equity Backed funding.

## Business Activities

> Blockchain goes a long way to facilitate moving currency from one entity to another eleminating the need for traditional centralized institutions. The process of creating new blocks or mining in and of itself has created a subset of centrailized mining companines controlling the creation of new blockchains. These companies have huge amounts of computing power and resources eliminating the ability for most to compete in this space. Mining companies are rewarded for their work (proof of work) when they solve complex algorithms confirming a blocks authenticitiy. In the case of Bitcoin mining companies earn bitcoin currency as payment for their work being the first to add new blockchains. This model although disruptive and not easily susceptable to hacking because of the elimination of a central DB creates an opportunity for additional decentralization.  

With a solid leadship team having an innovative technology sttategy and expertise in varying aspects of Fintech. ANkR is working to decentralize cloud computing and making the blockchain token model accessible to all. The future could present the ability for eveyday people to let their PC's compute and compete for mining opportunities even while they sleep. Using the concept of proof of useful work (PoUW) implemented by ANKR. This energy efficient concept improves the PoW incentive system by utilizing idle resources to perform useful computations. The PoUW system makes use of trusted proctors that monitor computation actions and randomly gives rewards in predetermined intervals. Those with higher computing performance for the peirod will have an increased opportunity to earn rewards. The PoUW system incentivizes every user that performs work and gives high performers the opportunity to earn more.

The PoUW system is a three tiered system that relies on
* Miners - to utilize their computing power to solve complex hashing problems
* Useful work providers - who provide miners with useful workloads
* Blockchain agents - to collect transactions and generate block templates for new blocks once the trusted proctor confirms the PoUW.

> Using a standard API to enable real world business adaption for their native data feed. ANKR uses its Multi-chain Plasma implementation to handle smart contracts which prevents transation overload in the PoUW chain. There are a number of new innovations on their road map such as 
* API standardization for connecting to business reader internet solutions
* Blockchain architecture for speed and scalability
* Trusted hardware security and confidentiality
* environmentally efficient mining and computing resource sharing
* reliable native oracle service 

>using its strong collaborations ANKR deployed thousands of nodes. They have blockchain projects with Acala, Polygo and Avalanche to enable one-click node deployment and hosting services. Realizing the abilito to expand into decentralized finance and moving away form being known only as a node hosting platform. ANKR is using its staking platform for DeFI trading, asset and lending services.


## Landscape

> ANKR has competitive advantages in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi), cloud transactions and crypto currency spaces. It is well positioned to be a Fintech disruptor for many years to come. By streamlining processes, improving the user experience and cutting cost making web3 technology accessilbe to everyone. ANKR's is on its wayy to helping in decentralization and continual evlovement of the internet where applications run on blockchains. They are creating a cost effective approach for everyone to participate using newer technologies to generate income opportunities.

with their plan to continue increasing its stategic partnerships and developing its robust technology, analyst predicts theirs will be a leading cryptocurrency. 


ANKR offers cost effective alternatives for developers and clients interested in deploying blockchain nodes.
