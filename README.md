ANKR

# SELF SUSTAINING BLOCKCHAIN FRAMEWORK

## Overview and Origin

> ANKR is based in Berkely CA and was founded in 2017 by co-founders Chandler Song, Ryan Fang & Stanley Wu. Developers of blockchain protocols seeking to improve efficientcy of public ledgers while providing a decentralized computing framework by reallocating cloud computing power left from idle data centers around the world. The model being deployed by ANKR could level the playing field by provding power to applicaitons, bitcoin mining, node hosting, the IOT and more. An estimated $27.3M has be received via Venture Capital Backed and Private Equity Backed funding.

## Business Activities

> Blockchain goes a long way to facilitate moving currency from one entity to another eleminating the need for traditional centralized institutions. The process of ceating new blocks or mining in and of itself has created subset of centrailized mining compaines controlling creation of new blockchains. These companies have huge amounts of computing power and resources eleminating the ability for most to compete in this space. Mining companies are rewarded for their work (proof of work) when they solve complex algorithims confirming a blocks authenticitiy. In the case of Bitcoin mining companies earn bitcoin currency as payment for work. This model although disruptive and is not easily susceptable to hacking because of the elimination of a central DB creates a further opportunity for decentrailzation.  

With a solid leadship team in place having an innovative technology sttategy and expertise in varying aspects of Fintech. ANkR is working to decentrailize cloud computing making the blockchain token model accessible to all. The future could present the ability for eveyday people to let their PC's compute and compete for mining opportunities even while they sleep. Using their concept of proof of useful work (PoUW) implemented by ANKR which is energy efficient and improves the PoW incentive system.
