#
## Overview and Origin

Based in Berkely CA ANKR was founded in 2017 by co-founders Chandler Song, Ryan Fang & Stanley Wu. Developers of blockchain protocols seeking to improve efficiency of public ledgers and creating a decentralized self computing framework. Their solution reallocates cloud computing power from idle data centers around the world. The model being deployed by ANKR could level the playing field by providing power to applications, bitcoin mining, node hosting, the IOT and more. An estimated $27.3M has be received via Venture Capital Backed and Private Equity Backed funding.

## Business Activities

Blockchain goes a long way to facilitate moving currency from one entity to another eliminating the need for traditional centralized institutions. The process of creating new blocks or mining in and of itself has created a subset of centralized mining companies controlling the creation of new blockchains. These companies have huge amounts of computing power and resources eliminating the ability for most to compete in this space. Mining companies are rewarded for their work (proof of work) when they solve complex algorithms confirming a blocks authenticity. In the case of Bitcoin mining companies earn bitcoin currency as payment for their work being the first to add new blockchains. This model although disruptive and not easily susceptible to hacking because of the elimination of a central DB creates an opportunity for additional decentralization. the POW model has negative environmental implications.  

With a solid leadership team having an innovative technology strategy and expertise in varying aspects of Fintech. ANKR is working to decentralize cloud computing and making the blockchain token model accessible to all. The future could present the ability for everyday people to let their PC's compute and compete for mining opportunities even while they sleep. Using the concept of proof of useful work (PoUW) implemented by ANKR. This energy efficient concept improves the PoW incentive system by utilizing idle resources to perform useful computations. The PoUW system makes use of trusted proctors that monitor computation actions and randomly gives rewards in predetermined intervals. Those with higher computing performance for the period will have an increased opportunity to earn rewards. The PoUW system incentivizes every user that performs work and gives high performers the opportunity to earn more.

Unlike the PoW system where miners race to be the first to solve random algorithms a PoUW miner solves real-world problems to authenticate blockchains. They are energy efficient, makes good use of CPU computing power and most important they maintain the integrity of the blockchain.  

#### The PoUW system is a three tiered system that relies on
> * Miners - to utilize their computing power to solve complex hashing problems
> * Useful work providers - who provide miners with useful workloads
> * Blockchain agents - to collect transactions and generate block templates for new blocks once the trusted proctor confirms the PoUW.
>
> Using a standard API to enable real world business adaption for their native data feed. ANKR uses its Multi-chain Plasma implementation to handle smart contracts which prevents transaction overload in the PoUW chain. There are a number of new innovations on their road map such as 
> * API standardization for connecting to business reader internet solutions
> * Blockchain architecture for speed and scalability
> * Trusted hardware security and confidentiality
> * environmentally efficient mining and computing resource sharing
> * reliable native oracle service 
>
>using its strong collaborations ANKR launched more than 15K nodes globally and a supported ecosystem in excess of 50 proof of stake blockchains. They have blockchain projects with Acala, Polygo and Avalanche to enable one-click node deployment and hosting services. Realizing the ability to expand into decentralized finance and moving away from being known only as a node hosting platform. ANKR is using its staking platform for DeFi trading, asset and lending services.

## Landscape

ANKR has competitive advantages in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi), cloud transactions and crypto currency spaces. It is well positioned to be a Fintech disruptor for many years to come. By streamlining processes, improving the user experience and cutting cost making Web3 technology accessible to everyone. ANKR's is on its way to helping with cloud computing decentralization and continual evolvement of the internet where applications run on blockchains. With applications supporting staking nodes, creating developer API's and enterprise solutions ANKR is creating an efficient, cost effective approach for everyone to participate using Web3 technologies to generate income opportunities.

With Web3 being highly focused on decentralization and more open source...applications will no longer be limited to big tech companies. Thus rights for earning money will be accessible to everyone. ANKR offers alternatives for developers and clients alike interested in deploying blockchain nodes. They make use of their native tokens in many ways such as node development, paying for app usage and voting for/against proposals. With an aggressive plan to continue increasing its strategic partnerships and developing its robust technology, analyst predicts ANKR will become a sought after cryptocurrency.

Poised to compete with tech giants like Amazon and Alphabet who own the centralized cloud platforms. ANKR is set to put up a great fight in the next phase of the IOT and in the decentralized cloud computing space. Their cryptocurrency provides another area in which ANKR will compete and it has value today to purchase services on their network. All indications identify ANKR to have amazing upside using its innovative approach to PoUW to create blockchains and use of its cryptocurrency.

## Results

Although the next iteration of the internet is here, but still under construction. The solutions ANKR is developing will help resolve many application based development needs. ANKR's blockchain-based solutions will assist everyone to develop decentralized applications easier and faster. They are needed especially developing next gen apps for Web3. Its features will make ANKR a comprehensive product for migration to the concepts of Web3. 

ANKR has emerged as a promising altcoin in the market. Its value has seen growth of 5,000% over the past year and a half. Its price is hovering around $0.01 and despite recent crypto selloffs its value has been relatively stable. It is predicted to be a long term investment opportunity with a potential important crypto currency as the internet evolves. The goal of ANKR is to eliminate intermediaries allowing users the ability to retain control of their data. ANKR currently enjoys some well established partnerships with prominent blockchains, more than 50 blockchain protocols and use of its PoUW to solve real-world algorithms. It is among the top 100 cryptos with over 7 Billion in circulation. ANKR is the only platform to combine node infrastructure, staking and DeFi to make developing and earning easy. Its value saw significant increases as more people began using their network realizing benefits of its versatility and convenience.
